## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are essential tools in computer science and software development. They are used to arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending, and are fundamental to various applications, including searching, data analysis, and more. This project focuses on exploring and implementing different sorting algorithms in the C programming language.

## Sorting Algorithms

The project includes the following sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort

Each algorithm is thoroughly explained and implemented with code examples.

## Big O Notation

In computer science, Big O notation is used to analyze the performance and efficiency of algorithms. It provides an upper bound on the time complexity of an algorithm as a function of the input size. This project discusses the Big O notations for each sorting algorithm, highlighting their best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios.

## Algorithm Implementation

The sorting algorithms included in this project are implemented in C. You can find the source code for each algorithm in their respective files within this repository.

## Data Structures

Sorting algorithms often interact with various data structures, such as arrays and linked lists, to arrange elements. This project explores the interaction between sorting algorithms and different data structures, providing insights into the advantages and disadvantages of using each data structure for sorting.

## Usage

To use any of the sorting algorithms provided in this project, simply include the respective header file in your C program and call the sorting function with your data. You can also refer to the code examples in the repository to see how each algorithm is used.
